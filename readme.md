This script calculates interrater reliabilities for Table 2 of Fairless et al 2013
Fairless et al 2013, doi: 10.1016/j.bbr.2012.08.051, PMID: 22982070, PMCID: PMC3554266
The interrater reliabilities are calculated for each pair of raters.  There are 3 raters.
Each interrater reliability is calculated as a Pearson's r and as an ICC(A,1)

The fictional data in "altereddata.txt" were modified from the original 
empirical data used in Fairless et al 2013.
I am using fictional data instead of the original data because I do not have 
permission of my co-authors to release the data into the public domain.  
Each row is a separate mouse/scoring period; 20 mice socially interacted in 10 pairs.
Each column is a different social behavior or rater; 3 raters scored 16 social behaviors.
NOTE:  Because these data are fictional, several important characteristics of
these data may be different from those of the original data (e.g., interrater
correlations are probably lower, behaviors may not sum properly)

Each of the 3 raters scored 16 social behaviors contained in 16 columns.
